            <h2>Welcome to my portfolio site (a work in progress)</h2>
            <p>The aim of this site is simple; create a place to store my work and present my technical self to the world. As mentioned above this is currently a work in progress. See the <a href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a> for details. As work and keeping up on the latest tech is keeping me busy I have little time for it at the moment :(</p>
        	<p>I'm currently happily employed by <a href="http://learnosity.com">Learnosity</a> in Sydney's CBD. So recruiters can hold off on making contact, thank you. Learnosity is a truly great place to work, 
        	where the team and management are always open to new ideas and approaches while managing to keep anyone from getting side tracked at the same time. I've had the opportunity to work on several new platforms and with many new technologies over the past 6+ months. I'm looking forward to continuing this trend over the coming years.</p>
