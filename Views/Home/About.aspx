        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>I'm a Web Developer, with a passion for the front end and an interest in expanding my already competent skills on the server-side and database. I consider myself to be passionate and motivated in the use of the latest technologies, in a manner that can offer the best experience to the broadest set of users. I’ve recently enjoyed working with ASP.NET MVC as I find its power and flexibility lets me get the job done with few compromises.</p>
        <p>As a Front End Developer I feel I need to be comfortable on the server-side and with the data to an extent that allows me create clean and flexible presentation layers. This is something that ASP.NET MVC has been very good at, allowing for serverside separation of concerns. A Front End Developer shouldn’t only be concerned with the client-side separation of the mark-up, presentation and behaviour. Instead they need to look onto the server and ensure that what is coming to a given view is also to the standard they apply to the browser.</p>
        <p>This interest in the server and data along with my degree in Computer Applications has meant I’ve worked at all levels of several web sites and applications. I’m confident enough in these skills to feel comfortable getting a site running alone when required.</p>

        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>So what makes me tick outside of computing? Three main things come to mind.</p>
        <h4>Skiing</h4>
        <p>I came to this pastime late in life during my first year of college. After which I went traveling to Canada. It was at that point with just under 40 days of skiing in my life I decided to become an instructor. I managed to complete 3 seasons between Whistler, BC, Canada and Mt. Hotham, VIC, Australia. I've also spent some time teaching at an indoor dry slope in Sandyford, Dublin, Ireland. <a href="http://www.skicentre.ie" rel="nonfollow">Skicentre.ie</a> is worth a look if you're nearby. Being based in Sydney at the moment means I'm a little closer to hitting the Japanese slopes which has been on my list for a long time.</p>
        <h4>Rugby</h4>
        <p>I was always the biggest kid growing up so I was sent on to a pitch to make it count from an early age. School and University saw me continue on the pitch but my size difference became less and my skills, while always keeping me on the first team weren't anything to write home about. University saw me involved off the pitch as well. In my first year I was Webmaster and Fresher Team Captain which got me involved with the club committee. To feed the couch potato and traveller in me I've been a passionate <a href="http://www.munsterrugby.ie"  rel="nonfollow">Munster Rugby</a> supporter. This has seen me without a voice regularly and all over rugby playing Europe. Similarly to skiing, Sydney may see me getting to do a little more with this interest as well. I'm currently looking into some tag and a fun club for the coming season.</p>
        <h4>Scuba Diving</h4>
        <p>I've always had a love for the water and was a strong competitive swimmer once upon a time, which kept me in the pool. It wasn't until I completed my PADI Open Water course on the Aran Islands, Galway Ireland at 16 that I feel in love with the oceans. I've since gained my Advanced license St. Pauls Bay, Malta and if I can continue to keep my girlfriend Kristina interested would love to get the next level. The repeating theme of Sydney benefits is obvious here and I hope to get diving regularly once my coding is done!</p>
