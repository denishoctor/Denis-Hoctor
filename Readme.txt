A primarily static website that shows my ability to code cleanly and a few of the MVC approaches I've been using in the past while. It’s a place to show my work and will have a blog shortly. The preference is to make it a b-spoke for experience but I may use a framework.

I'm currently working on emulating <a href="http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/">Beautyoftheweb/</a>'s component movement between pages. I plan to use a JS MVC pattern that will create an application for this.

In order to maintain SEO strength the content will be requested by AJAX for the application and as a Partial View by the main pages that will be available when JS is not present. This will maintain the progressive enhancement I've applied to the project so far.
